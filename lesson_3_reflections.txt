When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I work from different machines or if I want someone else to contribute to my
    work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So that I have control over what gets pulled to the remote repository. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

	Forks: When you "fork" a project, GitHub will make a copy of the project that is entirely
	yours. Fork is basically a clone on GitHub.
	Clones: A repository cloned into a new directory. 
	Branches: A branch it Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of the commits.
	The default branch is master.
