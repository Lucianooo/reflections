When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I work from different machines or if I want someone else to contribute to my
    work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So that I have control over what gets pulled to the remote repository. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

	Forks: When you "fork" a project, GitHub will make a copy of the project that is entirely
	yours. Fork is basically a clone on GitHub.
	Clones: A repository cloned into a new directory. 
	Branches: A branch it Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of the commits.
	The default branch is master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Local is up-to-date and it helps to see all previous changes when committing something

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Maybe saving the changes in different files and sending these files to my colleagues (probably
	the latest file). It's harder to see the changes since without Git it's not that easy to spot
	what has been changed or why something is no longer working. The only thing that comes to my mind
	that might be easier is that you don't have to learn Git or get familiar with GitHub. 


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	When I want someone else to take a loot at my changes as well.
