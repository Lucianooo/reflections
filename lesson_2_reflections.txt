What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used
	to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or
	initialize a new, empty repository. 
	I need to do it so that I can use the git functions (track changes, 
	compare previous versions etc.)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is "between" the working directory and the repository.
	Instead of commiting directly to the repository GIT allows you to add files to
	the staging area before commiting.
	This offers the value that a user can select which files he wants to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
